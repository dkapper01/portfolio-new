Working remotely has its advantages and disadvantages. However working remotely in Istanbul has its own unique set of advantages explicitly if you like cats.

Like many countries Turkey has its fair share of pets living on the streets. It is not uncommon to see a pack of dogs or an independent cat walking through the busy neighborhoods of istanbul.

I believe some cats are living their best lives in Istanbul. The cats are free to explore wherever they want. Storefronts are wide open so cats can come inside and take a nap or have some luck human pet them.

### Cat on my laptop.

This cat jumped right on my laptop when I wasn't looking. I didn't get mad I just took a picture. Every time I went to that coffee shop this cat was there.

### Mom cat taking care of it's babies

When I walked in to this coffee shop the mom cat was feeding it's kittens. After a while the cats started to play. The mom cat plays rough. Everyone walked in pet the cats.
