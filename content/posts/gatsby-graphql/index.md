Working remotely has its advantages and disadvantages. However working remotely in Istanbul has its own unique set of advantages explicitly if you like cats.

Like many countries Turkey has its fair share of pets living on the streets. It is not uncommon to see a pack of dogs or an independent cat walking through the busy neighborhoods of istanbul.

I believe some cats are living their best lives in Istanbul. The cats are free to explore wherever they want. Storefronts are wide open so cats can come inside and take a nap or have some luck human pet them.
