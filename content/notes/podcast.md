Accenture Consulting recently reported that the value of the Internet of Health Things will top \$163 billion by 2020. Within the next five years the healthcare sector is projected to be #1 in the list of top 10 industries for Internet of Things app development. This kind of high-stakes, leading-edge industry development attracts brilliant young minds! Among those, Elizabeth Russell, co-founder and CEO of DataDog Health and Daniel Kapper, co-founder of MediModo, whose companies are riding this wave.

Fueled by a deep curiosity and love of learning, Elizabeth and Daniel, respectively, have parlayed what started out as side projects into full-time entrepreneurial endeavors. They share how their corporate jobs influenced their desire to find technological solutions to the profoundly human conditions that affect our health and wellness.
