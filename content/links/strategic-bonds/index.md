Built a data entry application for TitanHouse using Node.js, Express, Mongoose, Pug and MongoDB. It replaced the companyâ€™s reliance on Google Sheets and Forms. The application took in data from users about firms, companies and executives. It organized, presented and distributed data in ways that Google Sheets could not. I used Passport.js for authentication, roles and permissions. The application increased staff productivity by 40% and improved the end user experience.
